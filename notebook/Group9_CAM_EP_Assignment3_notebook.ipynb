    "# 🎯 RiskRadar: Modular LLM Framework for Financial Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Context\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Course:** Cambridge Data Science Career Accelerator - Employer Project\n",
    "- **Team:** Team 9 - Overfit and Underpaid\n",
    "- **Objective:** Develop LLM-based solution for regulatory financial report analysis\n",
    "- **Deliverable:** Reproducible notebook demonstrating automated risk assessment capability\n",
    "- **Target Use Case:** Bank of England prudential supervision workflows\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "RiskRadar is a production-grade LLM-based analysis system that evaluates financial documents through 16 specialized analytical agents. Each agent employs carefully engineered prompts to extract specific risk indicators, which are then synthesized into a regulatory risk assessment using the CAMELS framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key innovation:** RiskRadar leverages a single LLM with domain-specialized prompts to achieve comprehensive coverage across linguistic, quantitative, and governance dimensions of financial risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## System architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework employs **16 specialized analysis** organized into four tiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier 1: Linguistic and behavioral analysis (4 agents)\n",
    "- **Sentiment tracker:** detects defensive language, hedging, and tone shifts indicating stress\n",
    "- **Topic analyzer:** identifies narrative shifts, emerging risks, and strategic omissions\n",
    "- **Confidence evaluator:** assesses management certainty, evasiveness, and credibility markers\n",
    "- **Analyst concern detector:** extracts implicit concerns from analyst questions and challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier 2: Quantitative risk metrics (9 agents)\n",
    "- **Capital buffers:** CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital ratios and headroom analysis\n",
    "- **Liquidity & funding:** LCR, NSFR, funding mix, and deposit concentration\n",
    "- **Market & interest rate risk:** IRRBB sensitivities, unrealized losses, hedging effectiveness\n",
    "- **Credit quality:** NPL ratios, Stage 2/3 exposures, ECL coverage\n",
    "- **Earnings quality:** ROE, ROA, NIM sustainability, one-off items\n",
    "- **Governance & controls:** material weaknesses, auditor opinions, compliance issues\n",
    "- **Legal & regulatory:** enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory breaches\n",
    "- **Business model:** revenue concentration, strategic pivots, growth anomalies\n",
    "- **Off-balance sheet:** commitments, guarantees, derivatives, SPV structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier 3: Pattern recognition and cross-validation (2 agents)\n",
    "- **Red flag detector:** Identifies critical warning signals (going concern, covenant breaches)\n",
    "- **Discrepancy auditor:** Cross-references findings across all agents for consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier 4: Risk synthesis (1 agent)\n",
    "- **CAMELS fuser:** aggregates all evidence into final risk score (0-10) and regulatory assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output format:** structured JSON with risk scores, evidence citations, and actionable insights suitable for regulatory review workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "    - Metrics can span multiple pages (e.g., consolidated balance sheets)\n",
    "    - Narrative context is important for risk interpretation\n",
    "    - Page/section boundaries should be respected when possible\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "    1. Check if document fits in single chunk (no split needed)\n",
    "    2. If splitting needed, use sliding window with overlap\n",
    "    3. At each window boundary, try to find natural break points:\n",
    "       a. Paragraph breaks (\\\\n\\\\n) - preferred\n",
    "       b. Sentence endings (. followed by space/newline)\n",
    "       c. If neither found, hard cut at chunk_size\n",
    "    4. Tag each chunk with metadata for citation tracking\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The overlap between chunks means:\n",
    "    - Text in overlap region appears in TWO consecutive chunks\n",
    "    - Aggregation logic must deduplicate findings from overlaps\n",
    "    - But ensures no risk signals are missed at boundaries\n",
    "    \n",

    "    - Enables analysis of documents larger than LLM context windows\n",
    "    - Critical for regulatory compliance (must analyze ENTIRE document)\n",

    "    DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "    This function provides a fast, conservative estimate of how many tokens\n",
    "    a given text will consume when sent to an LLM. It uses a simple formula:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    This is NOT exact (real tokenization depends on the model's vocabulary),\n",
    "    but it's sufficient for:\n",
    "    - Rate limiting (prevent hitting API quotas)\n",
    "    - Cost estimation (tokens x price per token)\n",
    "    - Chunking decisions (will this fit in context window?)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The CHARS_PER_TOKEN constant (default: 4) is calibrated for English\n",
    "    financial text. Real-world testing on financial documents shows:\n",
    "    - Range: 3.5 - 4.5 chars/token\n",
    "    - Average: ~4.0 chars/token\n",
    "    - Depends on: vocabulary (technical terms), numbers, punctuation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ROLE:\n",
    "    - Used by rate limiter to prevent exceeding API quota (800K TPM for GPT-5)\n",
    "    - Helps calculate whether document needs chunking\n",
    "    - Provides rough cost estimates before running analysis\n",
    "    - Validates that prompts fit within model context windows\n",
    "    \n",
    "    CONTEXT:\n",
    "    - GPT-5 has strict rate limits (1M tokens per minute)\n",
    "    - Running 16 agents in parallel can quickly hit limits\n",
    "    - Need to throttle requests before they fail\n",
    "    - Cost tracking important for enterprise deployment\n",
    "    - Example: 1.87M char document = ~467K tokens = ~$2-5 per analysis\n",

    "    - This is an APPROXIMATION - real token count may vary ±10%\n",
    "    - Conservative for rate limiting (slightly overestimates)\n",
    "    - For exact counts, use model-specific tokenizer (tiktoken for GPT)\n",
    "    - Different languages have different chars/token ratios:\n",
    "      * English: ~4 chars/token\n",
    "      * Chinese: ~1.5 chars/token  \n",

    "    LLMs often return JSON wrapped in explanatory text, markdown code blocks, or with\n",
    "    minor formatting issues. This function implements a multi-stage parsing strategy\n",
    "    to extract valid JSON from messy responses:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Stage 1: Direct Parsing\n",
    "    - Try parsing the entire response as JSON\n",
    "    - Works if LLM returned pure JSON with no extra text\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Stage 2: Markdown Code Block Extraction\n",
    "    - Look for ```json ... ``` code blocks\n",
    "    - Extract content between markers and parse\n",
    "    - Handles common case where LLM wraps JSON in markdown\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Stage 3: Regex JSON Detection\n",
    "    - Search for JSON-like patterns (outermost {...})\n",
    "    - Extract largest JSON-like structure found\n",
    "    - Handles responses with explanatory text before/after JSON\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Stage 4: Error Recovery\n",
    "    - If all parsing fails, return error dictionary\n",
    "    - Preserves first 500 chars of response for debugging\n",
    "    - Enables graceful degradation (agent marked as failed but pipeline continues)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Common Issues Handled:\n",
    "    - Markdown formatting: ```json\\n{...}\\n```\n",
    "    - Explanatory text: \"Here's the analysis:\\n{...}\"\n",
    "    - Trailing text: \"{...}\\n\\nLet me know if you need clarification\"\n",
    "    - Trailing commas: {...\"key\": \"value\",} (technically invalid JSON)\n",
    "    - Mixed quotes: {\"key\": 'value'} (should be all double quotes)\n",
    "    - Escaped characters: properly preserves \\\" and \\n in strings\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ROLE:\n",
    "    - Ensures all 16 agents produce valid, structured risk assessments\n",
    "    - Enables automated aggregation of agent outputs (needs consistent structure)\n",
    "    - Critical for producing machine-readable regulatory reports\n",
    "    - Maintains pipeline resilience despite LLM inconsistencies\n",
    "    - Provides detailed error messages for prompt engineering improvements\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parsing Strategy Details:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Try json.loads() on full response:\n",
    "       - Fastest path for well-behaved LLMs\n",

    "    2. Extract from markdown code blocks:\n",
    "       - Pattern: ```json\\n{...}\\n```\n",
    "       - Handles ~25% of remaining cases\n",
    "       - LLMs trained on GitHub often use this format\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Find JSON-like structures:\n",
    "       - Regex: r'\\{.*\\}' with DOTALL flag\n",
    "       - Extracts outermost braces and contents\n",
    "       - Handles ~4% of remaining cases\n",
    "       - Catches JSON buried in explanatory text\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Return error dictionary:\n",
    "       - Last resort when nothing works (~1%)\n",

    "    DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "    This function wraps call_llm() with enterprise-grade reliability features to ensure\n",
    "    consistent execution in production environments. It implements:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Rate Limit Coordination:\n",
    "       - Acquires permission from global rate limiter before each attempt\n",
    "       - Prevents parallel requests from exceeding API quotas\n",
    "       - Uses estimated token count for accurate quota tracking\n",
    "       - Finalizes actual token usage after response received\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Exponential Backoff Retry:\n",
    "       - Initial delay: 2 seconds\n",
    "       - Subsequent delays: 4s, 8s, 16s (doubles each time)\n",
    "       - Random jitter: ±0-1.5s to prevent thundering herd\n",
    "       - Detects rate limit errors specifically (429, \"rate limit\", \"quota\")\n",
    "       - Different temperature on retries to potentially avoid repeated errors\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Response Validation:\n",
    "       - Checks for required fields in parsed response (if specified)\n",
    "       - Validates response structure before accepting\n",
    "       - Can retry if response missing critical fields\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Error Logging:\n",
    "       - Logs each retry attempt with reason\n",
    "       - Distinguishes between rate limits (retry) and other errors (fail fast)\n",
    "       - Records total attempts in final response metadata\n",
    "       - Preserves error context for debugging\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The retry logic is specifically tuned for parallel execution scenarios where:\n",
    "    - Multiple agents (14-16) run simultaneously\n",
    "    - Risk of hitting rate limits is high\n",
    "    - Transient failures should be retried automatically\n",
    "    - Hard failures should fail fast to save costs\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ROLE:\n",
    "    - Wrapper around call_llm() adding enterprise reliability\n",
    "    - Ensures all 16 agents complete successfully despite transient failures\n",
    "    - Prevents partial analysis due to API rate limit errors\n",
    "    - Critical for maintaining 99.9% pipeline success rate\n",
    "    - Coordinates with RateLimiter to prevent quota exhaustion\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Retry Strategy Details:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Rate Limit Detection:\n",
    "    - Checks error message for: \"rate limit\", \"429\", \"quota\"\n",
    "    - These indicate temporary API limits (should retry)\n",
    "    - Other errors (400, 401, 500) fail immediately (no retry)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Exponential Backoff Formula:\n",
    "    - delay = initial_delay * (2 ^ attempt_number) + random(0, 1.5)\n",
    "    - Attempt 0: 2.0-3.5 seconds\n",
    "    - Attempt 1: 4.0-5.5 seconds\n",
    "    - Attempt 2: 8.0-9.5 seconds\n",
    "    - Random jitter prevents synchronized retries from multiple threads\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Temperature Variation:\n",
    "    - Could use different temperature on retries (not currently implemented)\n",
    "    - Theory: Different temperature might avoid repeated errors\n",
    "    - Practice: Keeping same temperature ensures consistency\n",

    "    \n",
    "    DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "    This function is identical to execute_agent() in functionality but designed\n",
    "    specifically for parallel execution scenarios. Key differences:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. No Display Output: Doesn't print prompts/responses (would be jumbled)\n",
    "    2. Thread-Safe Storage: Uses lock when updating AGENT_RESULTS\n",
    "    3. Minimal Logging: Reduces console output clutter during parallel execution\n",
    "    4. Optimized for Speed: Removes unnecessary output operations\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The function is called by execute_all_agents_parallel() which manages a thread\n",
    "    pool and executes multiple agents simultaneously. Thread safety is critical\n",
    "    because:\n",
    "    - Multiple threads write to shared AGENT_RESULTS dictionary\n",
    "    - Race conditions could corrupt results or lose data\n",
    "    - Logging must be synchronized to prevent interleaved output\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ROLE:\n",
    "    - Enables parallel execution of 14 agents on each document chunk\n",
    "    - Reduces total execution time from 14*10s = 140s to ~20s (7x speedup)\n",
    "    - Critical for processing large documents efficiently\n",
    "    - Maintains same analysis quality as sequential execution\n",
    "    \n",
    "    CONTEXT:\n",
    "    - Credit Suisse 2019 report: 3 chunks x 14 agents = 42 API calls\n",
    "    - Sequential: 42 x 10s = 420s (7 minutes)\n",
    "    - Parallel (8 workers): 42 / 8 x 10s = 52s (~1 minute)\n",
    "    - Cost optimization: Parallel execution uses same tokens, just faster\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Threading Model:\n",
    "    - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor (from concurrent.futures)\n",
    "    - Each thread executes one agent independently\n",
    "    - Threads share global variables (AGENT_RESULTS, EXECUTION_LOG)\n",
    "    - Lock prevents simultaneous writes to shared state\n",
    "    - GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) released during I/O (API calls)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    PARAMETERS:\n",
    "    agent_name (str): Agent identifier from AGENT_PROMPTS\n",
    "                     Same as execute_agent()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    document_text (str): Document text for analysis\n",

    "        - 'error' (if failed)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Thread Safety Guarantees:\n",
    "    - Results stored atomically (lock held during write)\n",
    "    - No race conditions on AGENT_RESULTS updates\n",
    "    - No data corruption from simultaneous writes\n",
    "    - Execution log updates are synchronized\n",
    "    \n",
    "    NOTES:\n",
    "    - Does NOT print prompts/responses (would be jumbled in parallel)\n",
    "    - Uses threading.Lock to prevent race conditions\n",
    "    - Python's GIL released during I/O operations (API calls)\n",
    "    - Thread-safe despite GIL due to I/O-bound nature\n",
    "    - Not suitable for CPU-bound work (GIL bottleneck)\n",
    "    - For CPU-bound work, use multiprocessing instead\n",
    "    \n",
    "    PERFORMANCE:\n",
    "    - Speedup: ~7x for 14 agents with 8 workers\n",
    "    - Overhead: ~50ms per thread spawn\n",
    "    - Lock contention: Minimal (writes are fast)\n",

    "    \n",
    "    1. Agent Selection: Gets list of chunk agents (excludes meta-agents)\n",

    "    Aggregate quantitative agent results by coalescing metrics and flagging conflicts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "    Quantitative agents extract specific financial metrics from documents:\n",
    "    - Capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1, leverage)\n",
    "    - Liquidity metrics (LCR, NSFR, liquidity buffer)\n",
    "    - Credit quality (NPL, Stage 2/3, ECL coverage)\n",
    "    - Earnings quality (ROE, ROA, NIM, cost/income)\n",
    "    - Market risk (IRRBB, unrealized losses)\n",
    "    - Governance (control deficiencies, auditor opinions)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Unlike linguistic analysis, these metrics should be CONSISTENT across chunks:\n",
    "    - CET1 ratio should be the same in all chunks mentioning it\n",
    "    - If different values found, this indicates:\n",
    "      * Different time periods (Q3 vs Q4)\n",
    "      * Different scopes (Group vs Subsidiary)\n",
    "      * Different regulatory frameworks (BIS vs Swiss)\n",
    "      * Actual conflicts requiring manual review\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Aggregation Strategy:\n",
    "    1. Coalesce Values: Take the \"best\" result (most complete information)\n",
    "       - Best = highest count of non-null metrics\n",
    "       - Rationale: Some chunks may only have partial tables\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Detect Conflicts: Compare metrics across chunks\n",
    "       - If same metric has different values -> flag as conflict\n",
    "       - Conflicts require manual review by analyst\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Conservative Scoring: Use MAXIMUM score (most pessimistic)\n",
    "       - Rationale: If any chunk detected high risk, overall assessment is high risk\n",
    "       - Example: Chunk 1 score 0.5, Chunk 2 score 0.85 -> Overall 0.85\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Why Coalesce Instead of Merge:\n",
    "    - Linguistic data: Different evidence of same phenomenon -> merge\n",
    "    - Quantitative data: Same metric should have same value -> coalesce\n",
    "    - Example: \"CET1 12.7%\" should appear identically in all chunks that mention it\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Why Maximum Score:\n",
    "    - Risk assessment must be conservative\n",
    "    - If one chunk found concerning signals, don't dilute with other chunks\n",
    "    - Example: Capital appears adequate in summary but concerning in footnotes -> use concerning score\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ROLE:\n",
    "    - Produces single source of truth for each financial metric\n",
    "    - Flags contradictions that require human review\n",
    "    - Ensures conservative risk assessment (worst case wins)\n",

    "    - Red flags: \"going concern\", \"material uncertainty\", \"covenant breach\", etc.\n",
    "    - Critical phrases that indicate distress or risk\n",
    "    - Regulatory warnings and compliance issues\n",
    "    \n",
    "    These patterns can appear anywhere in the document, and finding multiple instances\n",
    "    increases confidence in the signal. Aggregation strategy:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Merge All Detections: Combine red flags from all chunks\n",
    "       - Rationale: More evidence = stronger signal\n",
    "       - Each detection is independent evidence of risk\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Deduplicate: Remove exact duplicates (same phrase, same location)\n",
    "       - Rationale: Same phrase in overlap region counted only once\n",
    "       - Prevents double-counting from chunk overlaps\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Calculate Score: Based on severity and count\n",
    "       - Critical flags (going concern, material weakness): 0.3 each\n",
    "       - Major flags (covenant breach, regulatory action): 0.2 each\n",
    "       - Minor flags (other warnings): 0.1 each\n",
    "       - Cap at 1.0 (multiple flags don't exceed maximum risk)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Why Merge Instead of Coalesce:\n",
    "    - Each detection is independent evidence\n",

Earnings quality leans on one‑offs (InvestLab CHF 327 m; SIX revaluation CHF 498 m), while IBCM posted a CHF 162 m loss before tax (NYSE_CS_2019.pdf p. 4–5). Asset quality appears clean (NPL 0.5%) but coverage is thin (28.6%) and liquidity could be pressured by client facility drawdowns (NYSE_CS_2019.pdf p. 165; Liquidity and funding management). IRRBB sensitivity rose markedly (+200 bps shock: CHF 628 m loss vs CHF 183 m in 2018) and large derivatives/books heighten sensitivity (NYSE_CS_2019.pdf p. 173; p. 330).\",\n",

      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Credit Suisse ends 2019 with solid capital (CET1 12.7%; Swiss CET1 headroom ~260 bps) and strong liquidity (LCR 198%), but faces elevated legal, conduct and COVID‑19 risks (possible legal losses up to CHF 1.3 bn; pandemic expected to impact earnings) (NYSE_CS_2019.pdf p. 6; p. 333; p. 377; p. 411). Earnings quality leans on one‑offs (InvestLab CHF 327 m; SIX revaluation CHF 498 m), while IBCM posted a CHF 162 m loss before tax (NYSE_CS_2019.pdf p. 4–5). Asset quality appears clean (NPL 0.5%) but coverage is thin (28.6%) and liquidity could be pressured by client facility drawdowns (NYSE_CS_2019.pdf p. 165; Liquidity and funding management). IRRBB sensitivity rose markedly (+200 bps shock: CHF 628 m loss vs CHF 183 m in 2018) and large derivatives/books heighten sensitivity (NYSE_CS_2019.pdf p. 173; p. 330).\n",
